\begin{Abstract}
The Fixed Point theory, originating from Banach's Fixed Point Theorem for contractive mappings, has developed significantly to encompass a wider classes of mappings, such as nonexpansive mappings and their generalizations. Various iterative schemes, such as Mann, Ishikawa, and Agarwal, Thakur, JK, and others, have been developed for fixed point approximations of these classes of mappings in various spaces, both in linear spaces such as Banach spaces and in nonlinear spaces such as geodesic spaces. Recently, Sabri et al. proposed a new iterative scheme with faster convergence rates than previous iterative schemes in uniformly convex Banach spaces. In this study, we will analyze the convergence of Sabri's iterative scheme in geodesic spaces for approximating fixed points of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$-nonexpansive mappings. In this study, we obtain the $\Delta$ and strong convergence results of Sabri's iteration scheme for the fixed point approximation of the $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$-non-expansive mapping in the geodesic metric space $CAT_p(0)$. Based on numerical experiments, this iteration scheme has a faster convergence rate than the JK, Thakur, Agarwal, and Abbas iteration schemes. In addition, we obtain applications of this scheme for optimization problems, specifically for function minimization and tomography image reconstruction.
